|                                                                              |

==[ HOW TO USE ]================================================================
|                                                                              |
| 1. Click "Patch Hosts" to block license validation (product releases from    |
| 2018 and later) or use a firewall (see first note below).                    |
|                                                                              |
| 2. Select the target product and disconnect from Internet if required (see   |
| second note below).                                                          |
|                                                                              |
| 3. Some products will require extra information: "Name"/"User Name" and      |
| "Location"/"User E-Mail". You must complete these fields before generate an  |
| ID-Key. The rest of the products doesn't require any user information, but   |
| you can especify (OPTIONAL) a "Licensed User" name, that will be shown in    |
| the "About ..." dialog box and in the title bar of each product: enter the   |
| desired name and click "Save" to write the name to the registry.             |
|                                                                              |
| 4. Click "Generate". Use "Copy" to copy the full ID-Key or right click over  |
| the fields to copy each part separately.                                     |
|                                                                              |
| 5. Use the generated ID-Key to register the program. If the ID-Key is        |
| rejected, enable "Use new format", generate a new ID-Key and try again.      |
|                                                                              |
| NOTES:                                                                       |
|                                                                              |
| - In case you don't want to patch your hosts file, use a firewall to block   |
| any outgoing connection to: secure.nch.com.au                                |
|                                                                              |
| - Some old products will perform an online validation of the license info at |
| the time of registration (the keygen will warn you about wich products do    |
| this every time you pick one). To avoid this just disconnect from Internet   |
| before register. On these products, the validation is performed only the     |
| firt time you register the program. For products releases from 2018 and      |
| later, you will need a permanent block with a hosts file patch or firewall   |
| rule (see first note).                                                       |
|                                                                              |
| - If you have 2 options for registration: "Register New User..." and         |
| "Register Site License...", ALWAYS USE THE LAST ONE.                         |
|                                                                              |
| - After registration, if you can't see "Licensed software"/"Licensed User"   |
| or something like that in the title bar and/or "About" window, RESTART THE   |
| PROGRAM (don't forget to check the system tray).                             |
|                                                                              |
| - With some products, the "Register software..." and "Purchase online"       |
| options still available after register them. Just ignore it, it's perfectly  |
| normal.                                                                      |
|                                                                              |
